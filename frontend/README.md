File Structure:
Pages:

pages/_app.js - Main app logic with authentication, state management, and layout
pages/index.js - Simple home page (functionality handled in _app.js)
pages/login.js - Login page with form handling
pages/register.js - Registration page with form validation

Components:

components/Sidebar.js - Left sidebar with navigation and conversations
components/Navbar.js - Top navigation bar with auth controls
components/ChatContainer.js - Chat interface with message handling
components/Footer.js - Bottom footer with links
components/ProfileModal.js - Profile dropdown menu
components/ProfileDetailsModal.js - Settings modal with tabbed interface

Styles:

styles/globals.css - All CSS styles in one file

Key Features:

Centralized State Management - All state is managed in _app.js
Component Separation - Each UI section is a separate reusable component
Page Routing - Separate login and register pages with Next.js routing
Authentication Flow - Login state persisted in localStorage
Clean Architecture - Props passed down to components for functionality
Pure CSS - No external dependencies, all styling in globals.css

How it works:

_app.js handles all the main logic and renders different layouts based on the current route
For auth pages (/login, /register), it renders the page component with auth callbacks
For the main app (/), it renders the full chat interface with sidebar, navbar, chat, and footer
Components receive props from _app.js for all their functionality
State is lifted up to _app.js for centralized management
Authentication success triggers callbacks that update state and redirect users

This structure provides excellent separation of concerns while keeping all the main application logic centralized in _app.js.
